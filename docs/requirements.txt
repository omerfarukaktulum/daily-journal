📘 Project Specification: Memora – AI-Powered Personal & Family Journal

“Your memories, reimagined by AI.”

🌱 1. Vision

Memora is an iOS journaling app that makes writing and reflecting effortless through AI assistance.
Users can:

Write, speak, or upload photos to create diary entries

Get AI-generated reflections, summaries, or rephrasings

Organize memories into beautiful book-style journals

Choose to write for themselves or for their child

Memora bridges mindfulness, family storytelling, and AI-powered reflection, wrapped in a calm, privacy-focused experience.

🧩 2. Core Features (Functional Breakdown)
📝 A. Text-Based Journaling

Text editor (Markdown or rich-text compatible)

“Improve with AI” button:

Calls the backend (OpenAI or Anthropic API)

Uses a “tone-preserving” rephrase prompt

Returns 1–3 rephrased versions (user can select)

Auto-save drafts locally using Core Data or Realm

Option to add:

Tags (mood, topic)

Images

Location metadata

🖼️ B. Photo-Based Journaling

User uploads photo(s)

Optional metadata:

Character names (“Melike”, “Uğur”, “Yağız”)

Location (“Göteborg park”)

Date override

Backend AI creates a short descriptive or emotional story from image + metadata.

Photos stored in iCloud Drive (or optionally local-only, for privacy mode).

Implementation:

Use VisionKit or PhotoPicker

For image-to-text description:

Use Apple’s Vision framework for object detection

Optionally augment with GPT-4 Vision API for richer captioning (paid feature)

🎙️ C. Voice Journaling

User records diary via microphone

Audio saved locally first (Core Data + FileManager)

Send audio to Whisper API (or local speech recognition via SFSpeechRecognizer)

Display transcript in editor view

“Improve with AI” button rephrases the transcript

Optional optimization: store transcriptions in plain text (JSON) rather than full audio to reduce cloud costs.

📖 D. Diary Page Presentation (Book Mode)

Custom UI using SwiftUI:

PageViewController-like flipping animation

Themes (Classic, Minimal, Dark Mode, Child Mode)

AI automatically categorizes entries:

Family, Work, Reflection, Milestones, etc.

Users can export full diary as PDF (via PDFKit) or share pages

🔔 E. Smart Notifications

Daily local notifications (using UNUserNotificationCenter)

Adaptive reminders:

Frequency adjusts based on engagement

AI-driven follow-ups:

Backend analyzes last few entries for sentiment

Sends relevant push prompt, e.g.

“You mentioned feeling proud about Uğur’s first day — want to add an update?”

👶 F. Child Journaling Mode

Setup flow asks: “Who is this journal for?”

Options: “Myself” / “My child”

“For my child” unlocks:

Growth milestones templates

Memory tagging (age, photos)

Exportable timeline (PDF scrapbook)

Potential future expansion: allow sharing with partner (with end-to-end encryption).

💎 3. Monetization Model
Tier	Features	AI Access	Price
Free	Create text/photo/voice entries, limited themes	5 AI uses/day	Free
Premium	Unlimited AI improvements, voice transcription, advanced layouts, multiple journals	Unlimited	~$4.99/month or $39.99/year
Family Plan	Adds multiple child journals, shared access	Unlimited	~$7.99/month

Trial logic: 14-day full premium access upon install, then revert to free.
Use StoreKit 2 APIs for seamless in-app purchases and restoration.

☁️ 4. Data Storage Strategy
Local (Device-Side)

Core Data or Realm for all diary metadata

Media stored in app sandbox (FileManager)

AI responses cached locally to avoid repeated calls

Cloud (for backup / sync)

iCloud support via CloudKit

Each user’s data container is private to their Apple ID

No shared servers = better privacy compliance, lower hosting cost

Optional (Custom backend for analytics + AI)

If you need central AI orchestration:

Use a lightweight Node.js or FastAPI backend hosted on Render / Railway

Functions:

Handle AI requests (text rephrase, photo captioning, notification context)

Log anonymized usage data (for engagement insights)

Store only minimal, non-personalized data (for GDPR compliance)

🤖 5. AI Integration Plan
Primary AI Tasks
Task	Model	Optimization
Text rephrasing / summarization	GPT-4o mini / Claude 3 Haiku	Cache results client-side
Voice transcription	Whisper API (or Apple Speech)	Batch requests; offload to background thread
Image captioning (photo journal)	GPT-4 Vision	Offer as premium-only
AI prompts / reminders	GPT-4o mini	Generate short text server-side daily
Cost Control

Use tiered AI access (free = limited, premium = full)

Batch API calls: send full-day entries instead of per-entry calls

Cache rephrased entries locally to avoid duplicate costs

Use lightweight model (GPT-4o mini) for quick on-device reflection or summarization

If you reach scale, you can add AI quota pooling or rate limiting per user to manage API costs gracefully.

🔒 6. Privacy & Compliance

Journals stored encrypted locally (Keychain + CryptoKit)

No text or photos sent to servers without explicit AI-triggered action

Transparent privacy mode toggle (“Keep everything on device”)

GDPR/CCPA compliant; parental mode hides sensitive analytics

🧠 7. Tech Stack Summary
Layer	Technology
Frontend (iOS)	SwiftUI + Combine + Core Data
Cloud Sync	iCloud CloudKit
Voice Recognition	Whisper API or Apple Speech Framework
AI Backend	Node.js / FastAPI (optional) calling OpenAI API
Storage	iCloud Drive + local sandbox for media
Analytics	Optional: Firebase Analytics or Mixpanel (anonymous mode)
Payments	StoreKit 2
Push Notifications	Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)
🧭 8. Future Roadmap Ideas

AI sentiment dashboard (“Your month in words”)

“Memory rewind” — weekly AI summary of diary themes

Collaborative family journals

Child mode → auto-generate growth summaries

On-device AI models (e.g., Apple’s upcoming “CoreML GPT” integration)
